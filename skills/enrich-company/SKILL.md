# Enrich Company

Look up a single company's full profile in ZoomInfo.

## Input

The user will provide via `$ARGUMENTS` one of:
- A domain or website (e.g., `stripe.com` or `https://stripe.com`)
- A company name (e.g., `Stripe`)
- A stock ticker (e.g., `SNOW`)
- A ZoomInfo company ID

## Workflow

1. **Lookup metadata first** — before calling any other MCP tool, use `lookup` to load reference data for any fields relevant to the request. Use the returned `id` values (not display names) in all subsequent API calls. This ensures accurate parameter resolution, especially if a fallback search is needed.

2. **Identify the best match key** from the user's input:
   - URL or domain → use `domain` or `companyWebsite` parameter
   - Company name → use `companyName`
   - Ticker → use `companyTicker`
   - Company ID → use `companyId`

3. **Enrich the company** using `enrich_companies` with the identified parameters.

4. **If no match**, try a fallback:
   - Use `search_companies` with `companyName` for fuzzy matching — use lookup `id` values for any filters
   - Suggest alternatives from the search results
